So my heart's on fire
I couldn't care less

So your heart's on fire
I couldn't care less

I couldn't care

I couldn't care less, let's go!





The way you talk about it makes me wanna disappear
The way you move around me, you drive me mad

Because you know we grow cold
Because you know, we grow so tired, so tired





















So your heart's on fire
I couldn't care less

Yeah, your heart's on fire
I couldn't care less

I couldn't care... Less

I couldn't care
I couldn't care less, let's go!







Talk about it. Makes me wanna disappear. Makes me wanna disappear.





The way you move around me girl, you drive me mad, you drive me mad






Cause you know we grow cold


Cause you know we grow cold


Because you know, we grow so tired, we grow so tired
So tired



Oooooooh ooooo oooh
Oooooooh ooooo oooh
Oooooooh ooooo oooh
Oooooooh ooooo oooh
Oooooooh ooooo oooh

















So your heart's on fire
I couldn't care less, I couldn't care less, I couldn't care less

No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
