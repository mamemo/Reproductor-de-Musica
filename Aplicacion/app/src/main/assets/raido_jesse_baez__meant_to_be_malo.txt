I can see the sun come up
Time to get away from here
Time to make a new plan up again

Water never felt this good
And air that never felt so pure
Time to make a new plan up again
Well it was true when i said it
I'd rather forget it
When the past don't matter now
You think i owe you but i gotta go you see the past don't matter now
And it feels like life is taking over
It feels like its meant to be
And it feels like life is taking over, it feels like its meant to be
Cause i can see the sunrise on my way
I can see the road rise to meet me
I can feel the earth underneath my feet
And i can see the stars on top of me
And i say don't ever come down, come down, no
I need your light now, right now, yeah
Don't ever come down, come down no
I need your light now, right now, yeah

Now that i've come this far
I'm never looking back no-
Time to make a new plan up again
Things have never looked this clear
I'm never looking back no-
Time to make a new plan up again
Cause i can see the sunrise on my way
I can see the road rise to meet me
I can feel the earth underneath my feet
And i can see the stars on top of me
And i say don't ever come down, come down, no
I need your light now, right now, yeah
Don't ever come down, come down, no-
I need your light now, right now
And it feels like life is taking over, it feels like its meant to be
Well it was true when i said it
Id rather forget it
When the past don't matter now
You think i owe you but i gotta go you see the past don't matter now
And it feels like life is taking over, it feels like its meant to be
