I could go, high on you
I could go inside, take it all out
Down on you


I could go, touching you
Inch by inch of your skin
Using you

I could go, drinking you
Give me the blood
I need so much,
High on you

‘Cause I need what I want
And I feel you by my side
And I need to be,
And I want to be
High on you

I could go, breaking you
Inside my bones
I taste your soul
Crushing you

You are the drug,
My body wants
I'd use you once and again,
Once and again,
Once and again

‘Cause I need what I want
And I feel you by my side
And I need to be,
And I want to be
High on you

And I Need your hands,
Inside my heart,
I need your lips,
Screaming my name
I miss the smell
You left on my bed
I miss the taste,
Of your skin

Not every look is justified,
Not every word, starts a fight
I still think, you are,
The most beautiful thing
In my life

You are the drug, my body wants
I'd use you once and again,
Once and again, once and again.

‘Cause I need what I want
And I feel you by my side
And I need to be,
And I want to be
High on you

I miss the taste,
Of your skin.
