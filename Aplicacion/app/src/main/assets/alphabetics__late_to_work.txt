Late for work again Thats just what I do cause I can not wake up earlier
Oh no, when I think about it I get, oh, so depressed No way, this cant be really happening. someone kill me
(late for work again)




I remember when I was a little kid, didn't do shit



I remember when I had to wake at 8, its ok







Now we're old, we gotta be responsible






























Espero que te vaya como un culo por haber hecho mi vida una mierda total


Jugaste con mi amor, coraz√≥n.
Espero que te vaya mal.

Running late for work... Oh not again!
(late for work again...)






I remember when I was a little kid, didn't do shit





I rise and shine and die






Now we're old, we gotta be responsible


Oooh ooooh (oooh, oooh) x7.5
